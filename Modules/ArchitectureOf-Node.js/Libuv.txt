What is libuv?
libuv is a multi-platform library at the core of Node.js.
It provides the event loop, thread pool, and other low-level mechanisms to handle asynchronous non-blocking tasks efficiently.

======================================
Key Responsibilities of libuv

Event Loop...
libuv runs the event loop, which manages asynchronous tasks like network I/O, timers, and callbacks.
Tasks are processed in phases (e.g., timers, I/O callbacks) to ensure non-blocking execution.

Thread Pool...
Handles blocking tasks (e.g., file system operations, bcrypt hashing) by delegating them to a pool of threads.
Default size: 4 threads, meaning up to 4 blocking tasks can be processed simultaneously.
Why Needed: Prevents blocking of the main event loop, which runs JavaScript.

Timers...
Implements setTimeout, setInterval, and similar functions.
I/O Operations

Handles network I/O and file system I/O in an efficient, platform-independent way.
How libuv Handles Tasks
Non-blocking tasks (e.g., HTTP requests):

Handled by the event loop using OS features like epoll, kqueue, or IOCP.
These tasks do not block the main thread.
Blocking tasks (e.g., file system, bcrypt):

Sent to the thread pool to avoid blocking the event loop.
The main thread remains responsive while the task is processed in a separate thread.
Thread Pool:

By default, contains 4 threads. This means 4 tasks can execute simultaneously.
Configurable via the UV_THREADPOOL_SIZE environment variable (up to 128).

======================================
Why libuv Matters?
It enables Node.js to handle thousands of concurrent connections efficiently.
Balances non-blocking async tasks (via event loop) with blocking operations (via thread pool).

=====================================
Note:- this is in short...
"By default, libuv provides 4 threads, meaning 4 tasks are executed concurrently in the thread pool."
"The thread pool is specifically used for synchronous tasks like file operations or bcrypt hashing, which block code execution."
"libuv was introduced to handle these blocking tasks efficiently, ensuring the main thread stays free for other operations."

===============================================
Key Takeaways
libuv is the backbone of Node.jsâ€™s async, non-blocking architecture.
The event loop manages lightweight, non-blocking tasks.
The thread pool handles heavy, blocking tasks.
It ensures Node.js can perform well even under high loads.
